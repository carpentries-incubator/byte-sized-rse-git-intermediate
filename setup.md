### Shell with Git

On macOS and Linux, some version of a shell (e.g. `bash`) with Git will be available by default and no installation is needed.

If you do not have a bash shell installed on your system and require assistance with the installation, you can take a look at [the instructions provided by Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/#install-python)
for installing [shell](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#the-bash-shell) and [Git](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#git-1).

### GitHub Account

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a free, online host for Git repositories that you will use during the course to store your code in so you will need to open a free GitHub account unless you do not already have one.
